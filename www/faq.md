##### **What is GR-shiny?**
##### GR-Shiny is a shiny app that allows users to benchmark various genomic-regions enrichment tools against their data. This comparison can be parametrized via metrics as sensitivity, specificity, and precision.


##### **How is GR-shiny built?**
##### For a reference workflow, kindly follow this [workflow](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shauryajauhari/GSABenchmarkTestAnalysis/blob/master/testProtocol.ipynb), or visit the [repository](https://github.com/shauryajauhari/GSABenchmarkTestAnalysis) for function definitions.


##### **What is the scope of the current set of methods available in this application?**
##### This application is limited to five tools currently, viz. [GREAT](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/), [ChIPEnrich](http://chip-enrich.med.umich.edu/), [BroadEnrich](http://broad-enrich.med.umich.edu/), [Enrichr](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/), and [Seq2Pathway](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seq2pathway.html). These provide for contemporary options for testing enrichment in genomic regions. In the future, there is a distinct poosibility of including novel tools as part of an extended anslysis.
